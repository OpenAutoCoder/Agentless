"""

    create_skeleton_code = """
    You are an expert in writing test code for the automotive zone controller domain using a private framework repository called TAF (Test Automotive Framework). Your role is to generate pseudocode based on the extracted classes, methods, and logic ('glue_logic') that will fulfill specific test steps for a given requirement.

    ### Objective:
    Your task is to write pseudocode that outlines the test code necessary to implement a specific test step for the provided requirement. The pseudocode must include relevant classes, methods, and logic ('glue_logic') necessary to execute the test process.

    ### Event Types:
    Each step of the pseudocode should belong to one of the following event types, each representing a different phase of the test process:

    1. **stimulation**: Actions or triggers that simulate inputs or events within the system. This typically starts the test by interacting with the system under test.

    2. **retrieval**: Gathering the results or system states after the stimulation event. This is the data or response collected as a result of the initial trigger.

    3. **report**: Logging or documenting the retrieved values, outputs, or system states to ensure traceability and validation of the test results.

    4. **glue_logic**: Pure Python logic used to manipulate internal data, prepare inputs, or format outputs. These are non-API-related steps that handle test data, calculations, or other internal code logic. **No methods or classes are involved in this step**.

    ### TAF Framework Code Considerations:
    To ensure the pseudocode aligns with the TAF framework, consider the following guidelines:
    - Follow the design patterns and best practices established in the TAF framework.
    - Utilize the specific classes and methods that are relevant to the TAF's architectural structure.
    - Ensure any data manipulations or validations align with TAF's operational procedures.

    ### TAF Framework Code Input:
    {taf_code_description}

    ### Example Test Flow:
    You are expected to organize the pseudocode using the following format, ensuring each step is explained clearly with a description and any applicable methods. If it's a `glue_logic` step, ensure it contains pure logic with no associated methods.

    ### Requirement ###
    {requirement}

    ### Test Step ###
    {test_step}

    ### Pseudocode Example Output ###
    ```
    [
    {{ "step_explication": "stimulation: trigger event 1 to initiate test", "methods_used": ["full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3", "full_path2.file2.MyClass2: my_method2"] }} ,
     {{ "step_explication": "glue_logic: prepare input data for retrieval", "methods_used": [] }} ,
     {{ "step_explication": "retrieval: gather results from event 1", "methods_used": ["full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3", "full_path2.file2.MyClass2: my_method2"] }} ,
     {{ "step_explication": "report: log gathered results", "methods_used": ["full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3", "full_path2.file2.MyClass2: my_method2"] }} ,

     {{ "step_explication": "retrieval: obtain system response for event 2", "methods_used": ["full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3"] }} , 
     {{ "step_explication": "report: log final output for event 2", "methods_used": ["full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3"] }}
     ]
    ```



    ### Mandatory Rules:
    1. **Event Types**: The pseudocode must adhere to the event types defined above (`stimulation`, `retrieval`, `report`, and `glue_logic`).
    2. **glue_logic Rules**: No methods or classes should be associated with `glue_logic` steps. These steps should only contain internal logic manipulations.
    3. **Strict Method Usage**: Only use methods and classes listed in the reference. Do not create or fabricate method names or class names not provided.
    4. **Structured Format**: Return results in the exact format specified. Each step must be a valid JSON object with the keys `"step_explication"` and `"methods_used"`, where `"methods_used"` is either a list of methods or an empty list for `glue_logic` steps.
    5. **Order of Execution**: Ensure the pseudocode is well-ordered and sequential, as required by the test logic.
    6. **No Extra Information**: The output must contain only the requested pseudocode, no additional commentary or details.
    7. **Methode line format**: The line format of the method should be as the example : the file path separated by '.' and then separation between the path and the method should be by " : "  and the method should not include the parameters only the name of the method"
    like this : "full_path3.file3.MyClass3: my_method3" 
    
    Adherence to these rules is mandatory. Any deviation, such as fabricating methods or classes, or not following the output format or the format of the line of method, will result in task rejection.

    Your task is to verify if a set of pseudocode lines for a requirement can be mapped to one or multiple lines of continuous test code, ensuring each segment corresponds to the appropriate actions.

    ### What You Will Receive:
    1. The **requirement**, providing context for the functionality expected from the Device Under Test (DUT).
    2. A **set of pseudocode lines**, which represent steps from the DUT perspective that you will need to map.
    3. A **continuous chunk of test code**, which is written from the perspective of the test system interacting with the DUT.
    4. A **list of nodes** already taken to prevent overlap in your mappings.

    ### Your Task:
    1. **Map the pseudocode lines** to one or multiple lines of the continuous test code, ensuring that each action corresponds to valid test code lines.
    2. **Ensure non-overlapping mappings**: The lines you map must not overlap with previously mapped or reserved lines. The list of already taken lines will be provided.
    3. If a pseudocode line cannot be mapped to any test code line, return an empty response for that line.

    ### Key Considerations:
    - Each pseudocode line can map to **one or multiple lines** in the continuous test code.
    - **Do not include any setup or teardown actions** unless they directly contribute to the main pseudocode action.
    - If no appropriate line exists in the test code for a particular pseudocode action, return an empty response for that line.

    ### Inputs Provided:
    - **Requirement**:

    line 8: voltage = self.__power_path_ctrl.measure_actual_voltage(POWER_PATH_CHANNEL)
    ```
    



    ### Strict Guidelines:
    - **Return valid lines** from the continuous test code only. Do not generate or hallucinate lines that do not exist.
    - **Do not overlap**: Your result must not include any line already provided in the "lines Taken" list.
    - **Mappings should be one chunk**: the result should be a one continuous chunk of code with no gaps or missing lines.
    - **No extra information** should be included in the output.
    - Focus only on the **primary action** of each pseudocode line. Ignore setup or context lines that do not directly contribute to the primary action.
    - If no valid mapping exists, return an **empty response**.
    - Adherence to these guidelines is critical. Any deviation, such as generating non-existent lines or selecting any line already present in the **lines Taken** or the output is discontinuous or missing lines, will lead to immediate disqualification from the task.

I have created a pseudocode for implementing specific requirements, but it was written without full knowledge of how TAF works. Your task is to review and optimize this pseudocode for proper integration with TAF.

### What you will receive:
1. The **requirement**, which provides the context for the functionality expected from the Device Under Test (DUT).
2. The **existing pseudocode**, which outlines the steps and tools I initially planned for implementing the requirements.
3. The **full TAF repository structure** and API descriptions, including available classes, methods, and tools for implementing the tests.

### Your Tasks:
1. **Verify** the existing pseudocode against the TAF framework:
    - Identify **missing steps** that need to be added for proper functionality with TAF.
    - Identify **unnecessary steps** that TAF handles automatically and can be removed from the pseudocode.
2. **Optimize** the pseudocode:
    - Adjust any steps to better align with TAF's tools and methods.
    - Ensure the pseudocode is coherent, streamlined, and follows TAF conventions.
3. If any changes are needed, **update the pseudocode** and return the optimized version.
4. **If no changes are needed**, return the exact same pseudocode without any modifications.

### Key Considerations:
- The **requirement** is written from the perspective of the DUT.
- The **TAF methods** describe how the test system interacts with the DUT.
- Your final pseudocode should be efficient, removing any redundant steps and adding any necessary ones based on TAF’s capabilities.
