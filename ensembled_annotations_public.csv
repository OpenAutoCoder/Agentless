* The tests likely assume that the “get_prep_value” method works as defined in the Gold Patch. If the unusual solution implemented the “get_prep_value” method differently, perhaps by omitting the call to “to_python()”, it could lead to discrepancies in how UUID values are processed.

The default value for `samesite` argument is `None` (of type `NoneType`). For browsers, the `SameSite` attribute must be a string in the `Set-Cookie` header.

However, the test assumes that the conversion from float to integer involves truncation (using `int()`, which effectively removes the decimal part).

Issue 1:
When we use 'pytest.mark.parametrize' to create parametrized tests, pytest generated ID's for the test cases based on the input parameters. However, some these auto-generated ID's may include characters like '/', which can cause problems when you try to use the '-k' option to run specific tests. The '-k' option allows us to seelct tests to run by matching their names but if the test ID contains '/', pytest will throw an error like 'unexpected character '/''.
Code sample: Provided relevant code sample for the issue 1, which includes a '/' in the parameter.
Proposed solution: The solution is to sanitize the auto-generated ID's to remove or replace characters that might cause issues in shell commands.

Another issue mentions that using square brackets '[]' used in parametrized test ID's also cause problems in some shells, requiring the user to remember to quote the strings.

This classification is overly broad and neglects to verify whether all the powers are identical, which is crucial for accurate categorization. The proposed solution is to modify the function to ensure it checks that all variable powers are not only even but also the same, enabling more precise classifications, such as ""sum of squares"" or ""sum of fourth powers"". This correction would enhance the function's accuracy and potentially alter the solutions found by `diophantine(eq)`, which currently returns an empty set due to the misclassification.

Additionally, new test cases in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_diophantine.py` have been introduced to validate this logic: one to ensure an error is raised for equations with different powers and another to confirm correct classification when all powers are the same. These changes enhance the function's accuracy in classifying Diophantine equations, ensuring more precise and reliable results.

The current tests for the `classify_diop` function might fail to properly evaluate alternative valid solutions, particularly those that handle non-uniform power scenarios differently or use a different approach to achieve correct classification. For instance, the test expecting a `NotImplementedError` for equations with mixed powers could unfairly penalize a solution that accurately classifies such equations without raising this specific error.

Issue: The issue is regarding simplifying trigonometric functions with complex arguments. It occurs when trying to simplify the expression using sympy's 'simplify()' function.

sympy__sympy-24723,1.0,"Sympy is returning the wrong constant in the PDF for the Matrix Normal Distribution. It includes an extra factor of 2 making the result incorrect. The expected PDF should have a constant of 1/2π but Sympy gives 2/π. Although the explanation is clear the external links contain useful information to reach to the conclusion but it cannot be accessed here. So there are some blanks to fill in about the issue, but there is a sensible interpretation of what is required for a successful solution.",0.0,The test confirms the result of the formula is as expected the correction and that suffices as the two formulas won't return the same values as the difference is a coefficient of 2,0.0,,<15 min fix,59,78,78,"[78, 59, 72]",majority,False
sympy__sympy-24909,1.0,"The issue description clearly states the problem when units like watts are multiplied by prefixes like 'milli'. The description leaves some blanks regarding whether this issue might extend beyond just the 'milli' prefix and watts, as the user only mentions testing with watts and volts without confirming if it affects other units or prefixes.",2.0,"The test patch includes assertions to verify the prefix operations in SympPy's unit handling. Assertion ""assert m * W == W / 1000""  checks that multiplying the prefix 'm' (milli) by the unit W (watts) correctly scales the unit to w / 1000 (milliWatts), thereby addressing the described issue. However, it also contains two additional tests ensuring that multiplying the prefixes 'm' (milli) and 'k' (kilo), as well as dividing the prefix by itself, equals S.One, which is SymPy's symbolic constant for 1. This aligns with the change made in the gold patch to return S.One instead of 1. Since this change was not mentioned in the issue description, it could cause unreasonable solutions to fail.
