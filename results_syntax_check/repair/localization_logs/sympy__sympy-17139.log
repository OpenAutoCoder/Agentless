Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

The issue arises from the comparison of `rv.exp` with an integer. Since `rv.exp` can be complex (specifically when dealing with the imaginary unit `I`), trying to compare it with an integer can lead to a `TypeError`. 

To fix this, we can modify the comparisons to ensure that they handle complex numbers correctly. We will replace the comparisons with methods that check if the exponent is a real number.

Here is the required `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit:

```python
### sympy/simplify/fu.py

The error message indicates that there is an invalid comparison of a complex number, specifically `I`, in the code located in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. The problematic line is where `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` is used. The comparison `rv.exp < 0` may return a complex type which cannot be compared directly using relational operators.

To fix the issue, we should modify the code to explicitly check if `rv.exp` is a real number before making the comparison. We can utilize the `is_real` property of the expression.

Here is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to address this issue:

Based on the issue statement, the bug arises due to an invalid comparison of the complex exponent in the `_f` function in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file. The comparison `(rv.exp < 0)` is failing because `rv.exp` can be a complex number (in this case, `I`), and comparisons with complex numbers are not valid.

To fix the issue, we can modify the conditions to ensure we only compare `rv.exp` with integers. Specifically, we can check if `rv.exp` is a real number before performing comparison.

The bug in the code is related to the comparison of the exponent (`rv.exp`) of a power expression when it is a complex number. Specifically, the line `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` is causing a `TypeError` when `rv.exp` is of complex type, such as when it is the imaginary unit `I`.
