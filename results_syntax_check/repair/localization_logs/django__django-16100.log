--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

--- END ISSUE ---


Below are some code segments, each from a relevant file. One or more of these files may contain bugs.

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

Based on the issue statement regarding the lack of transaction handling in the `changelist_view` of the Django admin, it seems we need to ensure that operations that modify data are wrapped in a database transaction. Typically, Django provides a way to handle transactions using `atomic()` from `django.db`.

Based on the issue statement, the problem lies in the missing transaction handling for the `changelist_view` in the Django admin, specifically in the section of the code that processes the `list_editable`. The missing transaction could lead to inconsistent state in the database if an error occurs while processing requests that modify data.

To add transaction handling, we can use Django's `atomic` context manager which ensures that the block of code will either complete successfully (commit) or fail (rollback). Here’s how to implement this in the `get_results` method:

```python
### django/contrib/admin/views/main.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def get_results(self, request):
=======
    from django.db import transaction

    def get_results(self, request):
        with transaction.atomic():
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit involves importing the `transaction` module from `django.db` and wrapping the body of the `get_results` method with `transaction.atomic()`. This ensures that any database changes made within that method are wrapped in a transaction.

To address the issue of adding transaction handling to the `changelist_view` in Django admin, we need to ensure that the code is wrapped in a transaction to handle any database changes safely. The relevant section of the code where this should be applied is where the results are handled after querying the database.

Here's a proposed edit to wrap the relevant method in a transaction using Django's `transaction.atomic()` context manager. This will ensure that if any error occurs during the handling of the results, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing any unexpected state changes in the database.

```python

    from django.db import transaction

    def get_results(self, request):

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this change, we import `transaction` from `django.db` and wrap the existing `get_results` method's logic inside a `with transaction.atomic():` block. This ensures that any operations within this block are treated as a single transaction. If any exception occurs, all changes made during the transaction will be rolled back automatically.

To address the issue of missing transaction handling in the `changelist_view` in the Django admin, we need to ensure that the database operations are wrapped in a transaction. Typically, this can be done using Django's `transaction.atomic` context manager.

Based on the provided source code, we don't see the `changelist_view` function directly; however, we can infer that it is responsible for rendering the changelist and possibly modifying data based on user actions, which is where we need to add transaction handling.

Below is the proposed `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to wrap the data-changing operations in a transaction. We will add the necessary import and use the `transaction.atomic` context manager in the `get_results` method, assuming that method may modify data.

```python
### django/contrib/admin/views/main.py

        from django.db import transaction

        with transaction.atomic():
            paginator = self.model_admin.get_paginator(
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit introduces a transaction context around the relevant code that retrieves the paginator, ensuring that any potential database changes that occur in that context are handled properly with transaction management.

Based on the issue statement, the bug is that the `changelist_view` in Django admin needs to have transaction handling added to ensure that changes to the database are atomic and that unexpected states don't occur in case of errors.

To fix this issue, we can wrap the logic in the `get_results` method with a transaction. The Django framework provides a transaction management system that can be utilized to ensure that database operations are completed successfully or rolled back in case of an error.

We will likely need to import the `transaction` module from `django.db` and wrap the relevant database operations in a `transaction.atomic()` block.

Here is the proposed SEARCH/REPLACE edit:

```python

        with transaction.atomic():  # Start a transaction
            paginator = self.model_admin.get_paginator(
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change includes the import of the `transaction` module and wraps the paginator creation and result fetching in a `with transaction.atomic()` block to ensure that if any exceptions occur during this operation, all changes can be rolled back, preventing any partial updates to the database.

Based on the issue statement, the problem relates to the lack of transaction handling in the `changelist_view` of Django admin, particularly during operations that may change the database state. The provided code snippet does not explicitly show a transaction handling mechanism around any database writes, which can lead to inconsistent states if an error occurs.

To address this issue, we can wrap the relevant parts of the `get_results` method (or any other method that changes the database state) in a transaction context. Given that this is not visible in the current code snippet, we can add a transaction management block.

Here’s how to implement the necessary transaction wrapping:

```python

        with transaction.atomic():
            paginator = self.model_admin.get_paginator(
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change wraps the paginator creation and any operations that follow it in a transaction, ensuring that the changes made during the `get_results` execution will either fully complete or roll back if an error occurs, thus preventing unexpected states in the database.
