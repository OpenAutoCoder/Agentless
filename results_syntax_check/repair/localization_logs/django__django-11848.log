--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
django.utils.http.parse_http_date two digit year check is incorrect
Description
	 
		(last modified by Ad Timmering)
	 
RFC 850 does not mention this, but in RFC 7231 (and there's something similar in RFC 2822), there's the following quote:
Recipients of a timestamp value in rfc850-date format, which uses a
two-digit year, MUST interpret a timestamp that appears to be more
than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in
the past that had the same last two digits.
Current logic is hard coded to consider 0-69 to be in 2000-2069, and 70-99 to be 1970-1999, instead of comparing versus the current year.

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

            current_year = datetime.datetime.utcnow().year
            if year < 50:

                year += 1900
            if year > current_year + 50:
                year -= 100
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adjusts the logic for year interpretation, using the current year for the comparison and ensuring that years interpreted as being more than 50 years in the future are corrected.

To address the issue regarding the incorrect interpretation of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to modify the year handling logic. The current implementation incorrectly maps two-digit years to the ranges of 2000-2069 and 1970-1999, while the specification requires that any year more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.

Here's the required `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to fix the bug:

```python
### django/utils/http.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if year < 70:
                year += 2000
            else:
                year += 1900
=======
            current_year = datetime.datetime.utcnow().year
            if year < 50:
                year += 2000
            else:
                year += 1900
                if year > current_year + 50:
                    year -= 100
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the logic to correctly handle years by first checking if the year is less than 50, which would indicate it falls within the 2000-2049 range. If it is 50 or more, we add 1900 but also check if the resulting year exceeds the current year plus 50. If it does, we subtract 100 to correct the year back into the past range.

To address the issue described, we need to modify the logic that interprets two-digit years in the `django.utils.http.parse_http_date` function. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that years `0-69` should be interpreted as `2000-2069` and years `70-99` as `1970-1999`. According to RFC 7231, the correct interpretation should be based on the current year, with a cutoff of 50 years.

Here is the required modification:

```python

            if year > current_year + 50:
                year -= 100

```

This change:
1. Calculates the current year using `datetime.datetime.utcnow().year`.
2. Modifies the condition to correctly map years based on the 50-year rule.
3. Adds logic to handle cases where the interpreted year exceeds the current year plus 50, adjusting the year accordingly.

Based on the issue statement regarding the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `django.utils.http.parse_http_date` function, the existing logic incorrectly treats the ranges for two-digit years. According to the RFC, years should be interpreted based on the current year rather than being hardcoded to 2000-2069 and 1970-1999.

The following changes will be made to replace the hardcoded checks with logic that calculates the year based on the current year.

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change calculates the current year and adjusts the two-digit year based on the rules defined in the RFC. If the year is within 50 years of the current year, it adds 2000; otherwise, it adds 1900.

### Explanation of Changes:
- We first obtain the current year using `datetime.datetime.utcnow().year`.
- The year is then adjusted: if it is less than 50, we assume it is in the 2000s; otherwise, it is treated as being in the 1900s.
- An additional check is added to adjust the year down by 100 years if it exceeds the current year by more than 50 years, aligning it with the RFC specification.

Based on the issue statement regarding the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `django.utils.http.parse_http_date` function, we need to modify the logic that determines the year based on its two-digit representation. The current implementation incorrectly assumes fixed ranges for years, rather than interpreting them relative to the current year.

To fix this, we should calculate the current year and make the adjustments based on that instead of hardcoding the ranges. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit required to fix this issue:

```python

Based on the issue statement, the bug is located in the logic that interprets the two-digit year in an RFC 850 date format. Specifically, the current logic incorrectly assumes that years 0-69 always map to 2000-2069 and years 70-99 map to 1970-1999. Instead, the logic should compare the two-digit year against the current year to determine its correct century.

Here’s the required SEARCH/REPLACE edit to fix the issue:

```python
### django/utils/http.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if year < 70:
                year += 2000
            else:
                year += 1900
=======
            current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
            if year < 50:
                year += 2000
            else:
                year += 1900
            # Adjust based on the current year for years 50-99
            if year - current_year > 50:
                year -= 100
>>>>>>> REPLACE
``` 

This modification ensures that the two-digit year is properly interpreted according to the rules outlined in the RFCs, by factoring in the current year when determining whether to interpret the year as being in the 20th or 21st century.
