Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python

Based on the issue statement regarding the need to reduce `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, it seems that the optimization logic in the `optimize_inner` method may not be effectively handling the reduction of these specific operations. 

The current implementation appears to be focused on general operation reduction but does not explicitly target the `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations. To address this, we can enhance the logic to specifically check for these operations and optimize them accordingly.

Here are the proposed changes:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
=======
                # Check if the operation is an AddIndex or RemoveIndex

                    # Attempt to combine or eliminate redundant index operations
                    result = self.reduce_index_operations(operation, other, app_label)
                else:
                    result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this change, we introduce a new method `reduce_index_operations` that would handle the specific logic for reducing `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations. This method would need to be implemented to encapsulate the logic for combining or eliminating these operations effectively. 

This change ensures that we are specifically targeting the operations mentioned in the issue statement, which should help in reducing unnecessary migration operations.

Based on the issue statement regarding reducing the `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, it appears that the existing optimization logic in the `optimize_inner` method may not effectively combine or eliminate these operations as needed. 

To address this, we can introduce additional logic to specifically target `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations to reduce them more efficiently. 

Here are the suggested changes:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:

                elif not result:

                    if isinstance(operation, AddIndex) and isinstance(other, RemoveIndex):
                        # Consider merging AddIndex and RemoveIndex operations.
                        continue  # Skip adding this operation to new_operations.
                    elif isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and isinstance(other, AddIndex):
                        # Conversely, handle RemoveIndex and AddIndex.
                        continue  # Skip adding this operation to new_operations.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation:
- This modification introduces checks for specific operations, `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`, allowing the optimization process to skip adding those operations if they can negate each other, effectively reducing unnecessary migrations. 
- This logic should help in minimizing redundant `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations, addressing the core of the issue presented.

To address the issue of reducing Add/RemoveIndex migration operations, we need to modify the code in a way that optimally combines these operations when possible.

This change adds a specific check for when an `AddIndex` operation is followed by a `RemoveIndex` operation. In this case, we can simply replace both with a no-operation (`Noop()`), effectively reducing unnecessary migration operations.

Based on the issue statement, the goal is to reduce `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations during migration optimization. The provided code snippet already attempts to perform some optimizations, but to explicitly address the reduction of `AddIndex`/`RemoveIndex`, we may consider adding conditions to check for these operations and group them more effectively.

After reviewing the code, it appears that there are no explicit checks or logic to handle `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations, which may lead to suboptimal migration sequences. 

I will implement a solution to reduce these operations, assuming that we have appropriate methods available in the migration operations.

Here’s the proposed edit:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH

=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AddIndex) and isinstance(other, RemoveIndex)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this edit, I added a condition to avoid unnecessary reductions between `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations. This condition checks if the current operation is an `AddIndex` and the subsequent operation is a `RemoveIndex`, preventing the algorithm from treating them as reducible when they might not be. 

This change would ensure that we more effectively reduce operations that are specifically related to index modifications, potentially resolving the issue stated in the issue description.

To address the issue of reducing `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations as outlined in the issue statement, the provided code segment seems to be part of the optimization logic for migration operations in Django.

The code currently checks for reductions on the right side and keeps trying to optimize through different operations. However, it may not effectively combine `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations, missing an opportunity to reduce unnecessary operations.

We can enhance the logic that checks for reductions to explicitly handle `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations, ensuring they are combined or removed when possible.

Here’s a proposed edit to improve the optimization process:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    # Otherwise keep trying.
=======
                    # Check for specific index operations to optimize further.
                    if isinstance(operation, AddIndex) and isinstance(other, RemoveIndex):
                        # If we have an AddIndex followed by a RemoveIndex for the same field,
                        # we can eliminate both.
                        if operation.index.field == other.index.field:
                            # Skip both operations.

                            return new_operations
                    else:

This addition checks if there is an `AddIndex` operation followed by a `RemoveIndex` for the same field, and if so, it skips them both, effectively reducing unnecessary migration operations related to indexing.

Based on the issue statement regarding the reduction of `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, we can examine the provided code carefully.

The code is responsible for optimizing migration operations in Django's migration optimizer. The main loop iterates through operations and attempts to reduce them by checking if they can be combined or eliminated based on their relationships with other operations. The key part here is that the reduction logic may not be effectively identifying and combining index operations.

From the provided code, we need to ensure that the logic for reducing operations is correctly identifying and optimizing `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations specifically.

Given this context, here is a potential improvement. We will add a specific check to see if both operations are `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`, and if so, we can reduce them. This improvement should help in addressing the issue described.

This change introduces a specific condition to check if an `AddIndex` operation is immediately followed by a `RemoveIndex` operation, allowing us to skip both and reduce the total number of operations, thereby addressing the issue of excessive migration operations.

Based on the issue statement regarding the reduction of `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, it appears that the optimization logic in the `optimize_inner` method may not be effectively handling the reduction of these specific operations. The existing logic looks to combine operations but may not specifically target index-related operations for optimization.

To enhance the optimization logic, we can introduce specific handling for `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations. Below is the proposed change to improve the optimization process:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for i, operation in enumerate(operations):
=======
        for i, operation in enumerate(operations):
            if isinstance(operation, (AddIndex, RemoveIndex)):
                # Special handling for index operations to reduce them
                continue  # Placeholder for the logic to reduce index operations.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this case, I've included a placeholder comment for where the specific logic for reducing index operations should be implemented. Depending on the full context of the code, you will need to flesh this out to ensure it accurately reduces `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations.

If you have specific logic or conditions under which these operations should be reduced, please provide that, and I can refine the replacement further.

Based on the issue statement regarding reducing `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, it seems that the optimization logic in the `optimize_inner` method may not effectively merge these operations when applicable. We need to enhance the logic to better handle the reduction of index operations.

Here are the suggested changes to optimize the migration operations. The focus is on ensuring that when an index is added or removed, we recognize when these operations can be combined or eliminated.

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
=======
                elif not result:
                    # Can't perform a right reduction, but check if we can remove unnecessary index operations.
                    if isinstance(operation, AddIndex) and isinstance(other, RemoveIndex):
                        # Potentially remove both if they are canceling each other out
                        continue
                    right = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change checks for the specific case where an `AddIndex` operation can be paired with a `RemoveIndex` operation, allowing us to eliminate both instead of treating them as separate operations. This would help in reducing unnecessary operations in migrations related to index management.

Upon reviewing the provided code segment, it appears that there is a potential improvement in the way operations are processed, specifically in the `optimize_inner` method. The logic for extending `new_operations` could be enhanced to ensure that `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations are more efficiently reduced.

Here is the proposed change to better handle the reduction of `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations:

```

This change introduces a specific check for `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations to see if they can be reduced into a no-operation if they apply to the same field. This should help in reducing unnecessary migration operations, aligning with the issue statement's requirement to optimize these operations.

Based on the issue statement regarding reducing the `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations, the main point to focus on is in the `optimize_inner` method. The code attempts to optimize migration operations by checking if they can be reduced.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears there might be a lack of explicit handling for `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations which could lead to unnecessary migrations. We can implement a specialized check for these operations to reduce them accordingly.

Here’s a proposed change:

```python
### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            right = True  # Should we reduce on the right or on the left.
=======
            right = True  # Should we reduce on the right or on the left.
            # Optimize AddIndex and RemoveIndex operations
            if isinstance(operation, AddIndex) and isinstance(other, RemoveIndex):
                if operation.index == other.index:
                    # If we have an AddIndex followed by its corresponding RemoveIndex, we can optimize it out.
                    continue
            elif isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and isinstance(other, AddIndex):
                if operation.index == other.index:
                    # If we have a RemoveIndex followed by its corresponding AddIndex, we can also optimize it out.
                    continue
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of the Change:
1. The optimizations are added right after defining `right` to check if the `operation` and `other` are `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` respectively.
2. If they are found to be complementary (the same index), we can skip adding both operations to the `new_operations` list.
3. This will help reduce unnecessary migration operations that involve adding and immediately removing an index, which is likely the core of the original issue stated.
