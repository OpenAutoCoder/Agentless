Improper guessing of Mime Type for "br" and "Z" file types
Description
	
Below FileResponse will set the content type as text/html, even if the last file extension is "Z' or "br".
FileResponse(open('test.html.Z', 'rb'))
FileResponse(open('test.html.br', 'rb'))

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

To address the issue of improper guessing of Mime types for "br" and "Z" file types in the `django/http/response.py`, we need to enhance the `mimetypes.guess_type` functionality to correctly guess the content type for these specific extensions. 

Here's how we can implement the fix:

1. Identify the section where the `mimetypes.guess_type` is being used.
2. Modify the code to handle "Z" and "br" file extensions specifically.

The following edits can be made:

```python
### django/http/response.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                content_type, encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(filename)
=======
                content_type, encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(filename)
                # Add explicit mappings for "br" and "Z" extensions
                if filename.endswith('.br'):
                    content_type = 'application/brotli'
                elif filename.endswith('.Z'):
                    content_type = 'application/x-compress'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
``` 

This change checks if the filename ends with ".br" or ".Z" and sets the content type accordingly.

Based on the issue statement, the problem is that the `FileResponse` is not properly guessing the MIME type for the file extensions `.Z` and `.br`. The `mimetypes.guess_type` function is likely not returning the correct MIME type for these extensions, so we need to handle them explicitly.

### Proposed Fix

I'll add explicit handling for `.Z` and `.br` file types to ensure that the `Content-Type` is set correctly.

```python
### django/http/response.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                content_type = {
=======
                content_type = {
                    "br": "application/x-brotli",
                    "Z": "application/x-compress",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
                    "bzip2": "application/x-bzip",
                    "gzip": "application/gzip",
                    "xz": "application/x-xz",
                }.get(encoding, content_type)
```

This change ensures that when the MIME type is guessed for files with the `.Z` and `.br` extensions, they are correctly identified with their respective MIME types: `application/x-compress` for `.Z` and `application/x-brotli` for `.br`.

Based on the issue statement, the bug is in the `mimetypes.guess_type` method when it guesses the MIME types for files with extensions "Z" and "br". These extensions are not properly mapped to their correct MIME types, resulting in the incorrect content type being set as `text/html`.

```

This modification adds the necessary MIME types for the ".br" and ".Z" file extensions to the dictionary that maps encoding types to their corresponding content types. This will ensure that when a file with these extensions is handled, the correct content type is set.

To address the issue of improper guessing of Mime Types for "br" and "Z" file types, we need to modify the content type assignment logic in the `django/http/response.py` file. The current implementation does not handle the specific file extensions "br" and "Z", which should be assigned their respective Mime Types.

Here’s the necessary edit:

```python
### django/http/response.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                }.get(encoding, content_type)
=======
                }.get(encoding, content_type)

                    "br": "application/x-brotli",
                    "Z": "application/x-compress",
                }.get(filename.split('.')[-1], content_type)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit checks the file extension and assigns the appropriate Mime Types for files ending in "br" and "Z".
