--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
`sphinx-quickstart` with existing conf.py doesn't exit easily
**Describe the bug**
I've attached a screenshot in the screenshots section which I think explains the bug better.

- I'm running `sphinx-quickstart` in a folder with a conf.py already existing. 
- It says *"Please enter a new root path name (or just Enter to exit)"*. 
- However, upon pressing 'Enter' it returns an error message *"Please enter a valid path name"*. 


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
$ sphinx-quickstart
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

**Expected behavior**
After pressing Enter, sphinx-quickstart exits. 

**Your project**
n/a

**Screenshots**

I press Enter for the first prompt.


**Environment info**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python version: Python 3.8.5
- Sphinx version: sphinx-build 3.2.1 
- Sphinx extensions:  none
- Extra tools: none

**Additional context**
I had a quick search but couldn't find any similar existing issues. Sorry if this is a duplicate.

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

            sys.exit(0)

```

This edit adds an explicit check right after the prompt to see if the user has entered an empty string (by pressing 'Enter') and gracefully exits the program with a message instead of proceeding to validate the path, which leads to the error.

To address the issue with `sphinx-quickstart` where it does not exit gracefully upon pressing 'Enter' when an existing `conf.py` is detected, we can modify the prompt handling for when the user is asked to enter a new root path.

Based on the provided code segment, the check for the existing `conf.py` and the prompt to enter a new path is happening in a loop that does not properly handle the case when the user simply wants to exit by pressing 'Enter'. 

We need to ensure that the prompt correctly exits the program if the user presses 'Enter' without providing a new path.

Here’s the modification that can be made:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
=======
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path']:
            print(__('Exiting sphinx-quickstart.'))
            sys.exit(0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this modification, we added a print statement to indicate that the exit is intentional, making it clearer to the user that they are exiting the program when they press 'Enter'. The `sys.exit(0)` call is used to exit the program cleanly. This change ensures that the program behaves as expected when the user wishes to exit.

To address the issue with `sphinx-quickstart` not exiting properly when an existing `conf.py` is detected, we should take a closer look at how the prompt for the new root path is handled. The problem likely lies in how the exit condition is checked after the prompt for a new path.

Based on the provided code, when the user is prompted for a new root path and they press Enter, the current logic does not seem to correctly interpret an empty input for exiting due to the path validation function.

Here's how we can address this issue with a search/replace edit:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path']:
            sys.exit(1)
=======
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if d['path'] == '' or d['path'] is None:  # Change this line
            sys.exit(0)  # Change exit code to 0 for a graceful exit
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- The line checking the condition after the prompt has been modified to explicitly check if `d['path']` is an empty string or `None`. This ensures that the exit condition is correctly interpreted when the user just hits Enter.
- The exit code is changed from `sys.exit(1)` to `sys.exit(0)` to indicate a graceful exit, as the action of just exiting is not an error.

Based on the issue statement, the problem arises when the user attempts to exit the `sphinx-quickstart` prompt by pressing Enter when prompted for a new root path. The code currently checks for an existing `conf.py` and asks for a new path, but if the user simply presses Enter, it throws an error instead of exiting.

To fix this, we need to modify the condition that checks for an empty string in the `d['path']` variable. The current implementation does not handle a simple Enter key press correctly.

Here are the necessary edits:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)

        if d['path'] == '':
            sys.exit(0)  # Change the exit code to 0 for a clean exit
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when the user presses Enter (resulting in `d['path']` being an empty string), the program exits cleanly without throwing an error. The exit code is also changed to `0` to indicate a successful exit.

Based on the issue statement, the problem occurs when `sphinx-quickstart` is prompted for a new root path but fails to exit properly when the user presses Enter. The code segment responsible for this behavior is found in the `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` file.

The issue arises from the fact that the prompt for a new path allows for an empty string (which should exit), but the handling of this condition is not functioning correctly. After examining the relevant code, we can see that while the exit condition is checked after prompting for a new path, it doesn't allow for a proper exit when the path is already present.

Here’s the necessary code modification to fix the issue, ensuring that if the user presses Enter, the program will exit as expected:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)

        if d['path'] == '':
            print(__('Exiting...'))
            sys.exit(0)

In this modification:
- We added a print statement to inform the user that the program is exiting.
- The exit code is changed to `0`, which is commonly used to indicate a normal exit.

The issue seems to arise from the handling of the prompt where it requests a new root path. Specifically, the check for an empty input (when the user presses Enter) is correctly implemented to exit the process. However, the prompt for entering a new path does not check for the case where the existing path is indeed an empty string, leading to confusion. 

To resolve this, we need to modify the logic after the prompt to handle the case when the user simply presses Enter without providing a new path.

Here’s the appropriate search and replace:

```python

            sys.exit(0)  # Change the exit code to 0 for a normal exit

In this change, I've added a print statement to inform the user that they are exiting, and I've also adjusted the exit code to `0` to indicate that the exit is intentional and not due to an error. This should clarify the behavior when the user presses Enter.

Based on the issue statement, the problem arises when the user tries to exit `sphinx-quickstart` by simply pressing `Enter` when prompted for a new root path. The current implementation does not allow for an empty string to be accepted as a valid response, leading to an error message instead of exiting.

To fix this issue, we can modify the conditional check for an empty string so that it properly exits when the user presses `Enter`. 

Here’s the necessary edit to fix the problem:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path']:
=======
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if d['path'] == '':
>>>>>>> REPLACE
            sys.exit(1)
```

In this edit, we’ve changed the conditional from `if not d['path']:` to `if d['path'] == '':`, which explicitly checks if the `d['path']` variable is an empty string, allowing the exit to occur as intended.

Based on the issue description, it seems that the `sphinx-quickstart` command does not exit properly when the user presses 'Enter' after being prompted for a new root path when a `conf.py` already exists. The problem lies in how the prompt for the new root path is handled; specifically, the exit condition may not be triggering correctly.

Here's the required `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to fix the issue:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path']:
            sys.exit(1)
=======
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if d['path'] == '':
            print(__('Exiting Sphinx Quickstart.'))
            sys.exit(0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- I've changed the exit message to give the user feedback that they are exiting Sphinx Quickstart.
- The exit status for a clean exit is changed to `0`, which is conventional for successful termination of a program.

Based on the issue description, it seems that the problem occurs in the `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` file when `sphinx-quickstart` is prompted for a new root path. When the user presses 'Enter' in response to the prompt for a new root path, it tries to validate the input and does not handle the case where the input is an empty string correctly, leading to the error message.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if the user presses 'Enter' (thus providing an empty string), the program properly exits without trying to validate it as a path. We'll fix the conditional statement that checks for the empty input.

Here’s the necessary `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit to address the issue:

```python
### sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path']:
            sys.exit(1)
=======
        d['path'] = do_prompt(__('Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit)'),
                              '', is_path)
        if not d['path'] or not path.isdir(d['path']):
            print(__('Exiting...'))
            sys.exit(1)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- The `if not d['path']: sys.exit(1)` line is modified to also check if the path entered is indeed a valid directory using `path.isdir(d['path'])`. This way, pressing 'Enter' will properly allow the program to exit without throwing an error, and if an invalid directory is entered, it will also prompt the user correctly.
