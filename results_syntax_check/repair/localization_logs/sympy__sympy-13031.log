--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Behavior of Matrix hstack and vstack changed in sympy 1.1
In sympy 1.0:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns 
`(0, 6)`

Now, same in sympy 1.1:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns
`(0, 3)
`
whereas:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns
`(1, 6)

Based on the issue statement, it appears that the behavior of the `hstack` function has changed between SymPy versions 1.0 and 1.1, particularly when dealing with zero-sized matrices. The problem seems to stem from how the shapes of the matrices are being calculated and combined.

The `shape` property in the `blockmatrix.py` file is likely not accounting for the zero-sized matrices correctly when they are stacked horizontally. The current implementation sums the rows and columns of the matrices, but it does not handle the case where some matrices have zero rows correctly.

To fix this, we need to adjust the `shape` property to ensure that it correctly calculates the total number of columns when stacking matrices that may have zero rows.

Here is the proposed fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
=======
                max(block.rows for block in self.args) if self.args else 0,
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when calculating the shape, if there are no matrices (i.e., `self.args` is empty), it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it takes the maximum number of rows from the matrices to ensure that the shape reflects the correct dimensions when stacking.

Based on the issue statement, the behavior of the `hstack` function has changed when dealing with empty matrices. In SymPy 1.0, stacking matrices with differing column sizes resulted in the expected total columns, while in 1.1 it appears to default to the maximum number of columns in the individual matrices, which is causing the shape to be reported incorrectly when all matrices are empty.

This seems to relate to how the `shape` property is calculated in the context of the `hstack` function. The relevant computation in the `shape` property should account for the specific behavior of empty matrices.

This implementation sums the rows and columns of all provided matrices (`self.args`). However, it does not properly account for the fact that if all matrices are zero-sized (like in the provided test case), the resulting shape of the combined matrix should reflect them correctly.

Therefore, we need to modify the `shape` property to handle the case where all matrices are zero-sized in such a way that it returns `(0, total_cols)` when the sum of rows is zero.

Hereâ€™s our proposed fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @property
    def shape(self):
        return (sum(block.rows for block in self.args),
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
=======
    @property
    def shape(self):
        total_rows = sum(block.rows for block in self.args)
        total_cols = sum(block.cols for block in self.args)
        if total_rows == 0:
            # If there are no rows, the shape should reflect the total number of cols
            return (0, total_cols)
        return (total_rows, total_cols)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change enhances the function to ensure that when all matrices are zero-sized, the resulting shape will correctly show `(0, total_cols)` instead of incorrectly calculating it based on the individual blocks, thus fixing the behavior in line with what was observed in SymPy 1.0.

Based on the issue statement regarding the change in behavior of the `hstack` and `vstack` functions in SymPy 1.1, it seems that the calculation of the shape for certain combinations of zero matrices has changed. The expected behavior for the horizontal stacking of zero matrices with varying column sizes is not delivering the correct total shape.

The issue specifically arises in the calculation of the shape of the resulting matrix when stacking matrices of zero rows. It appears that the current implementation does not correctly account for the number of columns when all matrices have zero rows.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic in the `shape` property to ensure that it correctly computes the total number of columns in the case where there are zero rows.

This change ensures that when calculating the shape for matrices with zero rows, it takes the maximum column count from the provided matrices, ensuring that the resulting shape reflects the combined width of the matrices being stacked.

Based on the provided issue statement, the problem arises from how `Matrix.hstack` and `Matrix.vstack` handle empty matrices in SymPy version 1.1 compared to version 1.0. The change in behavior suggests a bug in how the shapes of the matrices are being computed when they are empty.

In particular, the problem lies in the `shape` property of a matrix, where the behavior needs to account for the dimensions of the individual matrices being stacked. The existing implementation in the file `blockmatrix.py` does not seem to correctly account for the case when all matrices are empty.

To fix this, we need to modify the `shape` property in the relevant class to correctly compute the shape when dealing with a mix of empty and non-empty matrices.

Here is the proposed `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py

                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of the Change:
- The shape is being computed such that if all blocks are empty (0 rows), it should default to at least 1 row in order to maintain consistency with previous behavior. This will ensure that the shape behaves correctly when calling `hstack` or `vstack` with empty matrices.

Based on the issue statement, it seems that the behavior of the `hstack` method has changed between SymPy versions 1.0 and 1.1 when dealing with empty matrices. Specifically, the expected behavior when stacking empty matrices has altered, resulting in incorrect shapes being returned.

The issue appears to stem from how the `shape` property computes the number of columns in the resulting stacked matrix when the input matrices have zero rows. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the `shape` property to correctly sum the columns of the non-empty matrices if they have rows of size zero.

Here are the necessary edits:

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that only blocks with a positive number of rows contribute their column count to the total shape calculation, thus maintaining the expected behavior when handling zero-row matrices in the `hstack` function.

Based on the issue statement regarding the behavior changes in `Matrix.hstack` and `Matrix.vstack` from sympy 1.0 to 1.1, it seems that the matrix operations involving zero-sized matrices are not behaving as expected. In the first case, the result should sum the column sizes of all matrices, which in the case of `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, and `M4` in sympy 1.0 was `(0, 6)`, but in 1.1 it incorrectly results in `(0, 3)`.

The bug may be localized in the handling of shapes or dimensions for the case when matrices have zero rows. The expected behavior must ensure that all columns are counted properly irrespective of their row sizes.

Given this analysis, I will create a search and replace edit to adjust the `shape` property for handling cases where the contributing matrices may have zero rows but contribute to the column count.

Here's the proposed edit:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                sum(block.rows for block in self.args),

                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of the Change:
- The `shape` method has been modified to ensure that if all blocks are zero rows, the first dimension defaults to `1` rather than `0`, which allows us to keep the column size aggregated correctly. This makes sure that when the matrices are stacked, we expect at least one row if there are any columns to represent.

Based on the issue statement, it seems that the behavior of the `hstack` function in SymPy has changed between versions 1.0 and 1.1, particularly when dealing with empty matrices. The difference in the output shapes suggests that the implementation of the `hstack` function might be treating empty matrices differently in the two versions. 

To address this issue, we should take a closer look at how the `hstack` function computes the resulting matrix dimensions when there are zero-row matrices involved. The bug is likely in the logic that computes the shape of the resultant matrix when stacking matrices of different column counts, especially when one or more of the matrices have zero rows.

Let's examine the relevant code and propose a fix based on that.

### Proposed FIX for `hstack` behavior

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @property
    def shape(self):
        return (sum(block.rows for block in self.args),
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
=======
    @property
    def shape(self):
        total_rows = max(block.rows for block in self.args) if self.args else 0
        total_cols = sum(block.cols for block in self.args)
        return (total_rows, total_cols)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation of the Change
- The existing implementation sums the rows of all blocks, which can lead to incorrect behavior when all blocks are empty (zero-row). Instead, we calculate the maximum number of rows from the blocks. If all the blocks are empty, this would correctly return zero. The number of columns is still summed as it was before, as this part of the behavior appears to be correct. 

This change should make the `hstack` function behave correctly in situations involving empty matrices.

Based on the issue statement, the change in behavior of `Matrix.hstack` and `Matrix.vstack` from SymPy version 1.0 to 1.1 likely relates to how the shapes of zero matrices are handled. In the provided block of code from `blockmatrix.py`, the computation of the shape seems to be directly dependent on the rows and columns of the matrices being passed.

The issue indicates that when stacking zero matrices of varying column sizes, the result in version 1.1 does not account for the total number of columns, leading to an unexpected shape.

To localize the bug, we can focus on the `shape` property and how it aggregates the dimensions of the matrices. The original implementation perhaps does not correctly compute the overall shape when dealing with zero-sized matrices.

Here is the necessary search and replace edit to fix the issue:

```python

This proposed change ensures that when computing the total number of columns, it accounts for the possibility of zero-sized matrices, thus preserving the intended behavior observed in version 1.0.

The discrepancy in behavior suggests that the computation of the shapes of the matrices when stacked may not be accounting correctly for the number of columns in the zero-column matrices.

The `shape` property of the block matrix is returning an incorrect value when one of the matrices is a zero matrix with zero rows and multiple columns. This likely needs to be adjusted to account properly for the sum of columns across the matrices.

Here is the proposed fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args))
=======
                sum(block.cols for block in self.args if block.rows > 0))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when calculating the total number of columns, we only sum the columns of blocks that have more than zero rows. This way, the columns from zero-row matrices do not incorrectly contribute to the total column count in `hstack` operations, aligning the behavior of `hstack` with the expectations defined in the issue statement.
